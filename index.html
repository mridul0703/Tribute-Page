            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span>A</span>lbert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Germany—died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc². He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>

                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. His father was Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and his mother was Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where his father and his uncle founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. Albert attended a Catholic elementary school from the age of five for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.</p>

                        <h4>Famed Physicist</h4>
                        <p>In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. His dissertation was entitled "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions". That same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world. The four papers were on the photoelectric effect (which would earn him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were pivotal to the foundation of modern physics.</p>

                        <h4>Death and Legacy</h4>
                        <p>Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76, in Princeton, New Jersey. His legacy continues to influence numerous fields, from theoretical physics to the philosophy of science. Numerous books, films, and works of art have been created to honor his contributions. His name has become synonymous with genius, and his work remains a testament to the power of human intellect and creativity.</p>
                        <p>Several places and objects have been named after him, including the element Einsteinium, the Albert Einstein Institution, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. His life and works continue to be studied and celebrated worldwide.</p>
